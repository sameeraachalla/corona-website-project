            <h1>What is corona virus?</h1>
            <p>A corona virus is a kind of common virus that causes an infection in your nose, sinuses or upper throat. 
                Most of the corona viruses aren't dangerous.
                <br><br>
                In early 2020, after the outbreak in 2019 in china, The world health oraganisation(WHo) identified SARS-Co-V-2 as anew type of corona virus. 
                This outbreak quickly spread around the world.
                <br><br>
                Covid-19 is caused by SARS-Co-V-2 that can trigger what doctors call respiratory tract infection.
                It can effect your upper respiratory tract(sinuses,nose and throat) or lower respiratory tract(windpipe and lungs).
                <br><br>
                It spreads just as other coronaviruses, mainly through person to person contact. Infections range from mild to deadly.
                <br><br>
                SARS-Co-V-2 is one of the seven corona viruses including the ones that cause diseases like Middle east respiratory syndrome(MERS) and sudden accute respiratory syndrome(SARS). 
                The other cornaviruses cause most of the colds that effect us during the year but aren't a serious thret for otherwise healthy people.

               <h1>PREVENTION</h1>
               <p>To prevent the spread of COVID-19:
                1.Clean your hands often.
                <br><br>
                2.Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.
                <br><br>
                Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
                <br><br>
                Wear a mask when physical distancing is not possible.
                <br><br>
                Donâ€™t touch your eyes, nose or mouth.
                <br><br>
                Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.
                <br><br>
                Stay home if you feel unwell.
                <br><br>
                If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.
                <br><br>
                Calling in advance allows your healthcare provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This protects you, and prevents the spread of viruses and other infections.
                <br><br>
                Masks
                <br><br>
                Masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from the person wearing the mask to others. Masks alone do not protect against COVID-19, and should be combined with physical distancing and hand hygiene. Follow the advice provided by your local health authority.</p>
